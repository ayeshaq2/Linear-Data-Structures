# Linear-Data-Structures
This project is part of a lab assignment for my course SE2205: Data Structures and Algorithms, prepared and assigned by Professor Quazi Mehbubar Rehman. 

For this project, we were instructed to use approproate linear data structures and perform their respective operations on the provided data. 
I made use of a Singly Linked List which was used to implement a Stack and Queue, and their specific operations were implemented.
